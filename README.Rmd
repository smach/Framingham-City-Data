This project aims to collect data about Framingham, Massachusetts and wrangle it so it is in a form useful for analysis. It focuses largely on election results -- more specifically local mayoral and City Council races as well as turnout information -- but there are other files here such as precinct shapefiles and property records.

Check out the [project website](https://smach.github.io/Framingham-City-Data/), which includes more info about available data plus a [searchable table of project files](https://smach.github.io/Framingham-City-Data/#search-available-files).
